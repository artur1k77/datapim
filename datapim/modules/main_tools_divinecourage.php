<b>Rules</b><br><br>
Player is ordered to select hero chosen by Divine Courage and must not refresh the page unless the hero chosen for him/her is already picked by another player or is unavailable for some other reason.
<br><br>
Player must only build items chosen by Divine Courage until all the items are ready. After the items are ready player can replace his/her items one by one meaning that player must not sell, drop or give away more than one item before filling the only empty item slot with fully finished item.
<br><br>
Player is allowed to build items in any order. Player is as well allowed to start building new item before old one is finished.
<br><br>
Items mentioned at main page can be bought without restrictions. Recapping: all consumables, non-recipe items that costs below 400, gem, bottle, couriers, magic wand, blink dagger and one ghost scepter.
<br><br>
If player manages to pick up Divine Rapier of other player and it is not part of his/her build or player has unfinished Rapier being built, player may keep the Rapier and replace last item she/he has not started to build yet.
<br><br>
For Lone Druid's Spirit Bear you may build same items than you can build for the hero itself. You only need to finish Lone Druid's build to be allowed to start replacing items.
<br><br>
If player accidentally assembles an item that is not part of the build, the item must be disassembled or sold immediately.
